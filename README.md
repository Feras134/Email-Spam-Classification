# SpamClassification

**SpamClassification** is a Python project that demonstrates how to build a text classification model to detect spam messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages and uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for prediction.

## Features

- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering)
- Tokenization and vectorization using TF-IDF
- Training a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Predicting whether new input messages are spam or not
